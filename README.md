# CSE-2nd-yr-B-programs
IT and DSA programs assigned to section B of 2nd year CSE. 


I will add particulars on how to contribute to this repository after sometime, Meanwhile feel free to contribute if you are already knowledgeable.
Ofcourse the prerequisite is to belong from CSE 2nd yr section B.

Points to note before opening a pr:
1.This repo will mainly focus on programs given as assignments(classwork or homework) and should be written in a way that will be accepted by the college,
so classmates can just copy blindly. So no fancy stuff here.
2.Fancy stuff will be included in an "Extras" folder.
3.Comment lines are encouraged wherever necessary.
